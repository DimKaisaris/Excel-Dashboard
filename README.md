# Excel-Dashboard

## Project Overview
In this Project I downloaded a dataset from https://www.other-levels.com/  
and followed the video instructions to create 
pivot tables and a super cool Dashboard!  
tools : MS Excel

## Long Story Short
The data is about sales revenue from onlines courses,call support, advertising methods,  
area,consultans and much more. 
You can access the raw data in table format *[here](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Excel-Dashboard/blob/main/excel%20files/Raw_Data.xlsx)*
I was mostly creating pivot tables and using them to create graphs and charts.
The Dashboard speaks for itself and maybe looks better with dark theme and background!  
Feel free to use the two slicers to interact with the dashboard.  
The sheet is protected, but if you want to move things around the psw is: 123.  
Here is the [DashBoard](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Excel-Dashboard/blob/main/excel%20files/DashBoard.xlsx)
